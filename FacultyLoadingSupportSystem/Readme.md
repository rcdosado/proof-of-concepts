Requirements
============

1. The load assigned to each faculty members are divided into three groups: teaching load, administrative load, and research load.
2. During the faculty load assignment and course scheduling, numerous constraints such as faculty preferences, and rules, are taken into consideration. Additionally, these processes require plenty of communication between the people involved such as the Chair, Vice Chair and Academic Programming Officer to negotiate with one another to properly allocate the limited resources such as classrooms, professors and students.
3. The Academic Programming Officer prepares and uploads a list of regular courses to be offered the following term per ID number (e.g. 113, 114), per specialization (e.g. Software Technology, Network Engineering) based on the flowchart.
4. Once uploaded, this list is accessible to the Chair and Vice Chair of each of the departments.
5. The Vice Chair will then fill up the table/spreadsheet with faculty that will teach the course and assign a schedule of the class
6. After accomplishing this task, the Vice Chair will then upload the spreadsheet back for the Academic Programming Officer to indicate the rooms where every classes will be held. In the event that there is a conflict in the room assignment, the spread will be submitted to the registrar.
7. Other information that are needed are the faculty preferences. This information is given by the faculty themselves, preferably through a feature in the faculty loading support system to input their preferences. Preferences should be based on schedule or could be on courses to handle. Note that faculty members themselves are not allowed to modify the spreadsheet directly, but there must be way to know what he/she is assigned with and to send feedback to the Chair or Vice Chair (e.g. confirmation or acknowledgment)
