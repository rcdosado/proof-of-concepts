Design Activity
===============

Draw the UML class diagram to show the relationship of the different classes as described below. Note that some of the details are not mentioned (like how much points is increased when winning a fight) because this is only focused on the design.

A Pokemon Trainer (a human) who encounters a wild Pokemon is able to capture that Pokemon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poke Ball at it. If the Pokemon is unable to escape the confines of the Poke Ball, it is officially considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. The Trainer keeps his collection of Pokemons in a Pokedex. Once captured, Trainers can send out any of their Pokemon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokemon. Pokemon already owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special circumstances in certain games. If a Pokemon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out (“faints”), the winning Pokemon gains experience points and may level up. When leveling up, the Pokemon’s statistics (“stats”) of battling aptitude increase, such as Attach and Speed. From time to time the Pokemon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle. In addition, many species of Pokemon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokemon, a process calld evolution. In which cse, the fighting and effect of the moves will be stronger (different) from before evolution.
